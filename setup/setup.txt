ok, to get interact with github you need to install git first. not a complicated install, just mindlessly click next until the wizard dissappears. i left the download link in the setup folder


once you install it, you can clone the repo on your computer using command line


cloning the github repo

	create project folder wherever you want call "new_game" for now, or whatever

	open command line in that directory (right click file explorer, select open in terminal)

	run these commands:

		git init

		git add remote origin "https://github.com/CoraRui/new_game"

		git pull origin main

workflow

	before working on the project, make sure to pull the latest version with:
	
		git pull origin main

	after finishing whatever changes you've made, commit those changes to your project, then push those changes back to the repo with:

		git add --all

		git commit -m "name for change made"

		git push origin main




eventually you'll probably want:

free
	godot - game engine
	gimp - image editor

paid
	fl studio - daw (dont need it unless you're gonna make music)
	aseprite - image editor (can just use gimp instead)

but you can get those later
